				<h4 id="list-item-1">Diversified Technique</h4>
				<p>This technique is the primary form of adjusting taught at many of the major chiropractic colleges world-wide. The technique is delivered through a hands-on approach where the chiropractor adjusts a specific spinal segment (subluxation) to restore correct motion and remove any neurological interference.</p>

				<h4 id="list-item-2">Drop Piece Adjusting</h4>
				<p>Drop Technique is an extension of diversified technique where parts of the adjusting table give way while the chiropractor applies pressure to a specific spinal segment (subluxation) to restore correct motion and remove any neurological interference.</p>

				<!-- <h4 id="list-item-3">Intersegmental Traction</h4>
				<p>Intersegmental traction tables are used to mobilize the spinal column while gently stretching the ligaments and muscles of the spine. The patient lies on his back while two rollers move along both sides of the spine. These rollers move along the spine for the allotted time of treatment, which is usually 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

				<h4 id="list-item-4">Active Release Technique&reg;</h4>
				<p><a href="http://www.activerelease.com" target="_blank">ART</a> is a patented, state of the art soft tissue system/movement based massage technique that treats problems with muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and nerves.  Headaches, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, shin splints, shoulder pain, sciatica, plantar fasciitis, knee problems, and tennis elbow are just a few of the many conditions that can be resolved quickly and permanently with ART. These conditions all have one important thing in common: They are often a result of overused muscles.</p>
				<p>Over-used muscles (and other soft tissues) change in three important ways:<br>
					<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
						<li>Acute conditions (pulls, tears, collisions, etc).</li>
						<li>Accumulation of small tears (micro-trauma).</li>
						<li>Not getting enough oxygen (hypoxia).</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h5>ART Treatment® Session</h5>
				<p>Each of these factors can cause your body to produce tough, dense scar tissue in the affected area. This scar tissue binds up and ties down tissues that need to move freely. As scar tissue builds up, muscles become shorter and weaker, tension on tendons causes' tendonitis, and nerves can become trapped. This can cause reduced range of motion, loss of strength, and pain. If a nerve is trapped you may also feel tingling, numbness, and weakness.</p>
				<p>These treatment protocols – over 500 specific moves – are unique to ART. They allow providers to identify and correct the specific problems that are affecting each individual patient. ART is not a cookie-cutter approach.</p>
				<h5>History of Active Release Technique&reg;</h5>
				<p>ART has been developed, refined, and patented by P. Michael Leahy, DC, CCSP. Dr. Leahy noticed that his patients' symptoms seemed to be related to changes in their soft tissue that could be felt by hand. By observing how muscles, fascia, tendons, ligaments and nerves responded to different types of work, Dr. Leahy was able to consistently resolve over 90% of his patients' problems. He now teaches and certifies health care providers all over the world to use ART.</p>

				<h4 id="list-item-5">Graston Technique&reg;</h4>
				<p>A typical Graston session will last about 30 minutes. During this time, Dr. Steph will spend time stripping out adhesions both statically and with motion. Dr. Steph uses six stainless steel instruments to detect adhesions. The curvilinear edge of the patented Graston Technique® Instruments combines with their concave/convex shapes to mold the instruments to various contours of the body. This design allows for ease of treatment, minimal stress to the clinician's hands and maximum tissue penetration.</p>
				<p>The Graston Technique® Instruments, much like a tuning fork, resonate in the clinician's hands allowing the clinician to isolate adhesions and restrictions, and treat them very precisely. Since the metal surface of the instruments does not compress as do the fat pads of the finger, deeper restrictions can be accessed and treated. When explaining the properties of the instruments, we often use the analogy of a stethoscope. Just as a stethoscope amplifies what the human ear can hear, so do the instruments increase significantly what the human hands can feel.</p>

				<h4 id="list-item-6">History of Graston Technique&reg;</h4>
				<p>The Graston Technique®, researched at Ball Memorial Hospital and Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, was conceived by an athlete who suffered a debilitating knee injury while water skiing.</p>
				<p>Frustrated at the lack of rehabilitation progress following surgery and conventional therapy, he applied his professional background in machining to create the initial Graston Technique® instruments to treat his soft tissue injury.</p>
				<p>In 1994, TherapyCare Resources Inc., parent company of Graston Technique®, opened an outpatient clinic in Indianapolis, where outcome data was gathered on a wide range of chronic and acute injuries. Five years later, the company turned all of its attention to teaching and training clinicians and research on the technique. Michael I. Arnolt, a co-founder, served as TCR president, for 19 years. In 2013, Graston Technique® was acquired by a newly formed Indianapolis-based entity, Graston Technique, LLC (GT-LLC). Todd R. Lugar is president &amp; CEO.</p>
				<p>Today, there are more than 16,775 clinicians worldwide—including athletic trainers, chiropractors and therapists—who use the Graston Technique® protocol to effectively detect–treat–resolve a myriad of connective soft tissue dysfunctions. There are also more than 260 professional and amateur sports organizations and some 1,760 outpatient facilities that use GT. This growing list of practitioners and clinics comprises what now is known as the GT Provider Network.</p>
				<p>Graston Technique® is part of the curriculum at 57 respected colleges and universities and has participated in or is engaged in research projects at Indiana University, Texas Back Institute, New York Chiropractic College and St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.3GT is utilized at some 1,760 outpatient facilities and 43 industrial sites, by 260 professional and amateur sports organizations, and is part of the curriculum at 57 respected colleges and universities. Some benefits for the patients include:<br>
					<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
						<li>Decreases overall time of treatment.</li>
						<li>Fosters faster rehabilitation/recovery.</li>
						<li>Reduces need for anti-inflammatory medication.</li>
						<li>Resolves chronic conditions thought to be permanent.</li>
					</ul>

				<h4 id="list-item-7">Therapeutic Taping</h4>
				<p>Therapeutic taping has been around for nearly 30 years but became widely known almost overnight during the Beijing Olympics. Many pro athletes can be seen wearing a version of this tape now during events. This taping is different from the athletic tape that is wrapped tightly to add stability to joints. The tape is elastic and is applied with a stretch dependent on the desired treatment outcome. Tape is usually worn for 3-5 days when it either starts to come off or you remove it. Our tape is latex free to avoid skin irritation.</p> -->

				<h4 id="list-item-8">Functional Fitness</h4>
				<p>The chiropractors at Noble Choice Chiropractic tailor exercises to your specific care. These exercises are geared to help return you to your optimal performance. Exercises range from simple movement with no weight to help regain your full range of motion, to weighted exercises to help strengthen areas that are weak.</p>
				<!-- <h4 id="list-item-9">Low Level Laser</h4>
				<p>Low Level Laser is used to affect the body at the cellular level in multiple different ways. LLL helps by decreasing inflammation which may be causing pain. The primary use is for the treatment of acute pain.</p> -->

				<h4 id="list-item-10">Ultrasound</h4>
				<p>Therapeutic Ultrasound is used to treat soft-tissue injuries. The application of therapeutic ultrasound decreases inflammation resulting in a quicker recovery time from soft-tissue injuries.</p>
