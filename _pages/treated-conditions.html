Chronic pain may be due to multiple factors such as arthritis, disc herniations or working certain jobs with extended periods of sitting, driving or standing.

			<h4 class="card-header">Disc Herniations</h4>
			<div class="card-body">
			    <p class="card-text">In the spine, cartilaginous discs are located between each vertebrae. These discs act as cushions, protecting vertebra from trauma or injury. A healthy disc also allows movement of the spine in a normal, pain-free, fashion. There are 23 spinal discs in the spine but the largest discs lie in the Lumbar spine. These lumbar discs are most commonly herniated. A disc herniation occurs when the disc protrudes from its proper space. This can cause inflammation and pressure on the nearby nerves. Improper ergonomics, trauma, or repetitive motions and overuse are common causes of disc herniations. Patients can feel anything from a mild tingle to a disabling sting or burn. Pain is usually limited to one side of the body and is most typically a shooting pain down the leg, in cases of lumbar disc herniations.<br><br>The chiropractors at Noble Choice Chiropractic have treated disc herniations with success through the use of: Active Release Technique&reg;, Graston Technique&reg;, therapeutic taping, and chiropractic adjustments.</p>
