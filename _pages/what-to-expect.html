				<p class="lead">At Noble Choice Chiropractic, our chiropractors strive to develop a relationship based on trust and honesty. During the first visit, a new patient will complete the paperwork to provide Dr. Steph and Dr. Jon the necessary information about your specific condition and health history. You will then have a consultation with Dr. Steph and Dr. Jon to discuss your health history, specific condition and any questions you may have. After your consultation, the doctors will then perform a thorough orthopedic and neurologic exam and take a complete set of x-rays.</p>

			<p>The doctors will correlate all the information gained from the consultation, exam and x-rays to complete a Report of Findings. Most patients have four main questions:
				<ol>
					<li>What is wrong with me/Can you help me?</li>
					<li>What are you going to do?</li>
					<li>How long will it take?</li>
					<li>How much will it cost?</li>
				</ol>
			If you can be helped by chiropractic, the doctors will answer all your questions and discuss your individual treatment plan. If Dr. Steph and Dr. Jon believe that you are not a chiropractic candidate, they will refer you to the appropriate health care professional.</p>
