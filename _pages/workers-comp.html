				<h1 class="display-4">Worker's Compensation</h1>
				<p class="lead">Unfortunately, accidents on the job site do occur. Many employees are unaware that they have the right to select a doctor of their choice for treatment. The employee may select any physician, chiropractor, psychologist or podiatrist licensed in the state of Wisconsin. Employees are also allowed first and second choice of doctor, meaning that if the employee does not have confidence in the first doctor, a second choice is allowed. The employer must be notified of this change but cannot object to it.</p>

			<p>This means that if an employee is not satisfied with their current treatment provided by the first choice doctor for a work injury, they are allowed to switch to Noble Choice Chiropractic as their second choice doctor to continue their care.</p>

			<p>Together with Cost Reduction Technologies, Noble Choice Chiropractic is able to offer Pre-hire Evaluations, worker compensation rehabilitation and Functional Capacity Exams all in one location!</p>
