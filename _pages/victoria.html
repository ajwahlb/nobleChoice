			<p>Victoria has been with Noble Choice Chiropractic since February of 2019 and currently lives in Marshall, WI with her parents, sister, and 3 cats. Since 2014, she has worked for a local dairy farm braving the hot and cold weather to milk cows. In her free time, Victoria enjoys singing, fishing, and playing Echure with her family. She is currently still undecided in furthering her education and looks forward to what experiences Noble Choice Chiropractic brings to her in the future.</p>
