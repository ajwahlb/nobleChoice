				<p class="lead">Noble Choice Chiropractic is pleased to announce its partnership with Cost Reduction Technologies (CRT)! Many companies require a pre-hire assessment to evaluate an employee and determine whether he or she can safely perform job tasks associated with the job such as heavy lifting, twisting, unloading, etc. Companies may notice their workplace injuries continue to rise despite employees passing the pre-hire evaluations administered by other providers. The issue is that these pre-hire evaluations are subjective, meaning that the strength is perceived by the examiner and not objectively measured by any standards.</p>

			<p>CRT provides a cost-effective measure for industry to reduce workplace injuries before they occur. CRT uses iso-kinetic technology and equipment to match the physical capability of the employee with the physical demands of the job. This helps to reduce work-related injuries and associated costs.</p>

			<p>Dr. Jonathon and Dr. Steph have been trained by CRT to properly administer the exams. A typical exam takes about 15 minutes and the results are sent to the company immediately after.</p>
