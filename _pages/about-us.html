				<p class="lead">Dr. Jonathon and Dr. Steph Pinnow are chiropractors in Sun Prairie serving all individuals who seek to live a healthier life and perform at their best. We serve people of all ages and abilities but focus on active adults. We believe that active consumers in Sun Prairie need more than just a chiropractor; they need a doctor who can treat both structural and soft tissue conditions naturally and effectively. The doctors of Noble Choice Chiropractic provide exclusive soft tissue techniques such as <a href="http://www.grastontechnique.com" target="_blank">Graston Technique&reg;</a> and <a href="http://www.activerelease.com" target="_blank">Active Release Technique&reg;</a> (ART), which are needed not only in Sun Prairie but also the Madison area. These techniques allow the doctors to treat neuromuscular conditions no other chiropractors can treat without specialized certification.</p>

			<p>Dr. Jonathon grew up in Minot, North Dakota with his family of five. Dr. Jonathon became very interested in chiropractic after suffering a whiplash injury due to a car accident in high school. After receiving chiropractic care, he was able to return to football and an active lifestyle within weeks of the accident. After witnessing chiropractic himself and seeing his mother benefit from chiropractic, he knew that he wanted to help others through chiropractic.</p>

			<p>Upon high school graduation in 2006, Dr. Jonathon attended Minot State University. He obtained the credits necessary to enroll in chiropractic school in just three years. While attending <a href="http://www.nwhealth.edu" target="_blank">Northwestern Health Sciences University (NWHSU)</a>, Dr. Jonathon took extra classes to finish his undergraduate degree. He graduated from NWHSU in the fall of 2012 with a Doctorate of Chiropractic and a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology.</p>

			<p>After meeting his wife Dr. Steph at Northwestern Health Sciences University, he moved to Madison to be near her family. He has eased into the Dairy State by picking up Euchre and becoming a Badger football fan but he continues to be a deeply rooted Vikings fan! Dr. Jonathon is excited to help provide chiropractic care to the community of Sun Prairie and its surrounding area.</p>

			<p>Dr. Jonathon enjoys spending his down time weight training, watching and attending football games, snowboarding, watching movies, playing cards and being with family and friends.</p>

			<p>Dr. Steph has wanted to be a chiropractor since she was 17 years old. She interviewed her mother's chiropractor for one hour and left the office that day, proudly stating "I know what I want to do for the rest of my life". She never looked back.</p>

			<p>Dr. Steph attended the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse after high school. She double majored in Biology and Spanish and was able to study abroad in Spain for a summer. After graduating from UWL, she called Bloomington, Minnesota her home for 3.5 years while she attended <a href="http://www.nwhealth.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern Health Sciences University</a>. Dr. Steph brought home to Wisconsin her Doctorate of Chiropractic and her husband, Dr. Jonathon.</p>

			<p>Dr. Steph believes that her compassion is her biggest asset. She truly cares about every one of her patients and enjoys being a part of their lives. She believes this is the job she was meant to do.</p>

			<p>Drs. Steph and Jonathon have two children together; Hayley and Duke. They reside in DeForest and love being a part of the community there as well as Sun Prairie. If Dr. Steph has any free time at all, you'll usually find her working out, reading or doing anything that involves the outdoors. She loves being a mom and spending time with her family.</p>

			        		<p>Dr. Steph grew up on a fruit farm in Oregon, Wisconsin. She has always been an active person, from spending summers running around in the strawberry fields to competitively playing in soccer and tennis throughout high school. Dr. Steph's first experience with Chiropractic was in high school  She interviewed a Chiropractor as part of a school assignment and after an hour in the clinic, she knew what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.</p>

							<p>Dr. Steph attended the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse after high school to focus on her Chiropractic career.
