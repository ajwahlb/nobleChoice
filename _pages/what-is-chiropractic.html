			<p>The brain and spinal cord control nearly every function of the body. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves which exit from the spinal column. The most delicate and arguably the most important organs of the nervous system are the brain and the spinal cord, which are protected by the skull and vertebrae, respectively.</p>

			<p>The brain sends signals down the spinal cord and out to organs in tissues in the body through the use of nerves. Similarly, information is also passed from the organs and tissues back through the spinal cord until it reaches the brain. When body structures such as cells and organs are functioning normally, a state of health or normal physiology exists.</p>

			<p>The problem is when the normal physiology is disrupted. As nerves pass through the joints, they are vulnerable to interference. Interference can occur when spinal biomechanics are compromised and not functioning properly. Chiropractors commonly call this interference a "subluxation", which simply means that there is a misalignment of the joint that interferes with the body's ability to send and receive nerve signals properly. This can give you symptoms such as pain, numbness and tingling but it can also affect each organ differently. For example, a person with a subluxation in the lower back nerve roots may have low back pain, but she may also suffer from constipation, painful urination or menstrual problems because of the organs that are innervated in this region.</p>

			<div class="grey rounded">
				<p><em>Subluxations can be caused by several life experiences such as a difficult childbirth, stress, car accident, falls and many more.</em></p>
			</div><br>

			<p>A chiropractor detects these misalignments in your spine and corrects them using a chiropractic adjustment. The goal of chiropractic is to remove interference from the nervous system and allow the body to function at its optimal level, or a state of health. Chiropractors are natural and non-invasive physicians that specialize in treating the spine.</p>
